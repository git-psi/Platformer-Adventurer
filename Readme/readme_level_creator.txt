*Creator Level

The "level creator" allows you to create the level of the game.

Warning !
Any saved changes (or "restart") are final,
no rollback is possible.

The wheel allows you to change block,
enemy or object to pose.

The keys are very simple:
 -Right Mouse Button : Remove "block"
 -Left Mouse Button : Put "block"
 -Right Arrow : Move world right
 -Left Arrow : Move world left

Of course, you have to leave room for the player's spawn,
at the bottom left.

It is widely advised to prohibit access to the ends of the world...
